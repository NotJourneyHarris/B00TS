B00TS Drum Machine

Designed for my CSC 132 class, B00TS is a charming little retro-inspired drum machine. 
Named after the onomatopoea "boots n cats" used to mimic drum sounds and engineered to operate on a Raspberry Pi

Key Highlights:
Utilizes libraries like Tkinter, Librosa, and Pygame, enabling the time-stretching of drum loops to align with any audio track.
Features a custom-designed, handcrafted wooden casing inspired by vintage computer terminals, complemented by a GUI that mirrors this nostalgic aesthetic.
Incorporates LED lights synchronized with the music for visual flair.

Notes:
Completed in less than a month with three iterative versions, B00TS exemplifies my rapid concept development and implementation skills. 
This project not only demonstrates my software development capabilities but also my ability to create a unique and engaging user experience through the integration of technology and design.
